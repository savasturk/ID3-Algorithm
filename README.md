ID3 ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION

This program implements the ID3 Algorithm for constructing a Decision Tree in python without any inbuilt packages.

Language used : Python

Steps to run the code:

1. Download any sample data sets for training,testing and validation and place in a folder.
2. Open command prompt and open the directory that contains the ID3.py file or open any Python IDE and run the file.
3. Enter the commmand "python .py Example is as follows: "python ID3.py F:/Data_set1/training_Set.csv F:/Data_set1/test_Set.csv F:/Data_set1/validation_set.csv" 
4. The program will construct the tree based on the training set and displays it. It will also compute the accuracy of the data sets when tested with the constructed tree.
